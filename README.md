# Doom Tracker

Track your cumulative floor and loot chances at the Doom of Mokhaiotl. 

Doom Tracker automatically records how many floors youâ€™ve completed since your last drop for each item type - uniques, pet, cloth, eye, and treads - and calculates your cumulative drop chance based on the official rates for each floor.

Your progress is saved between sessions. You can toggle the plugin to show progress for each individual unique (turned off by default). 




Inspired by the [Pyramid Plunder Counter](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/pyramid-plunder-counter).
